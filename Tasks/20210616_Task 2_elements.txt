<div>: The Content Division element
    >> The <div> HTML element is the generic container for flow content. 
    >> It has no effect on the content or layout until styled in some way using CSS 
        (e.g. styling is directly applied to it, or some kind of layout model like Flexbox is applied to its parent element).
    >> As a "pure" container, the <div> element does not inherently represent anything.
    >> Instead, it's used to group content so it can be easily styled using the class or id attributes,
        marking a section of a document as being written in a different language (using the lang attribute), and so on.

    >> Note: The align attribute is obsolete; do not use it anymore. 
        Instead, you should use CSS properties or techniques such as CSS Grid or CSS Flexbox to align and position <div> elements on the page.

    >> The <div> element should be used only when no other semantic element (such as <article> or <nav>) is appropriate.


<section>: The Generic Section element

    >> The <section> HTML element represents a generic standalone section of a document, 
        which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it. Sections should always have a heading, with very few exceptions.
    >> Using a section without a heading
        Circumstances where you might see <section> used without a heading are typically found in web application/UI sections
        rather than in traditional document structures. In a document, it doesn't really make any sense to have a separate section of content without a heading to describe its contents. 
        Such headings are useful for all readers, but particularly useful for users of assistive technologies like screenreaders, and they are also good for SEO.
        
<article>: The Article Contents element

    >> The <article> HTML element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, 
       which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication). 
       Examples include: a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, or a blog entry, a product card, a user-submitted comment,
       an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content.
    >> A given document can have multiple articles in it; for example, on a blog that shows the text of each article one after another as the reader scrolls,
       each post would be contained in an <article> element, possibly with one or more <section>s within.
    >> Each <article> should be identified, typically by including a heading (<h1>-<h6> element) as a child of the <article> element.
    >> When an <article> element is nested, the inner element represents an article related to the outer element. For example, the comments of a blog post can be <article> elements nested in the <article> representing the blog post.
    >> Author information of an <article> element can be provided through the <address> element, but it doesn't apply to nested <article> elements.
    >> The publication date and time of an <article> element can be described using the datetime attribute of a <time> element. Note that the pubdate attribute of <time> is no longer a part of the W3C HTML5 standard.
